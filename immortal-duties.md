## Coding

#### Head Coder
---

The responsibilities of the Head Coder include helping guide the path of Sentience's future features. The Head Coder has the final say on coding project priorities, and which bugs need to be 
worked on before others.

#### Coders
---

These imms work with the head coder to implement necessary changes to the game. Sometimes these are new features, sometimes they are bugfixes, and sometimes they are simply enhancements to existing game systems. Alongside the Head Coder, these imms know more about the game's inner workings than anyone else.

#### Testing
---

While primarily part of the coding team, Testers can fall under building as well as coding. While they typically work behind the scenes on testports, their duties involve validating bug reports and ensuring that the solutions to issues are not worse than the issues themselves. They play a major role in ensuring that everything continues to run smoothly.

## Building

#### Head Builder
---

The Head Builder is meant to be the expert on the the game's world. They should be familiar with the story and setting, as well as overall balance. The Head Builder has final say on reviewing zones before they become available to players, and must be able to understand scripting as well as the direct building systems, as they have to ensure that everything comes together in a harmonious whole.

#### Builders
---

Builders make the world. Typically, this duty is divided into three sub-roles, the builder, the scripter, and the edtior. Builders are expected to be able to perform at least one of these three tasks, but the more they can handle, the better.

- Builder: Handles traditional OLC, creating rooms, objects, mobiles, and so on. Should be proficient with both writing descriptions as well as familiar with the function of various flags that can be set on their creations.
- Scripter: Masters of interactivity, Scripters should be comfortable working with Sentience's scripting engine to bring the creations of the Builders to life.
- Editor: Typically works with both of the other roles, as well as the Head Builder. Editors help with ensuring that spelling and grammar are correct in player-visible strings.

#### Housing
---

Builders tasked with providing support to players that need their houses worked on. Typically scripting in this role is light, most work involving standard OLC and editing duties.

#### Churches
---

Builders tasked with providing support for churches, to bring their church halls to life. As with the Housting duty, scripting is typically light in favor of OLC and editing.
